# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes a secure authentication mechanism for user registration and login, along with role-specific dashboards to ensure that users can only access data and features aligned with their assigned roles. This design enhances security and ensures precise access management.

## Key Features

- **Authentication System**: Provides secure user registration and login.
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Displays customized dashboards based on user roles.
- **Efficient Architecture**: Leverages Node.js and MongoDB for scalability and performance.
- **Enhanced Security**: Incorporates best practices to safeguard user data.

## Getting Started

- Node.js (version 12.0 or later)
- MongoDB (version 4.0 or later)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

### Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Project**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd your-rbac-project
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following entries:

   ```plaintext
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
   PORT=3000
   SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
